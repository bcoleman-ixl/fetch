Many teachers that work with students who have special learning requirements use IXL because it is flexible and allows students to access all grade levels while practicing at their own pace. Students have the option to go back and review previously-studied material or move ahead to try new skills at any time.\n<br>\n<br>Additionally, IXL provides the option to hide both the grade level and timer if the students are sensitive to these components. You can use the Topics menu as a guide to finding skills to practice rather than searching only by grade level.\n<br>\n<br>To find out how real teachers are using IXL as a supplemental program in their RTI/MTSS and special education classes, visit our blog by clicking on the following link: https://blog.ixl.com/2016/01/21/how-to-implement-ixl-with-an-rtimtss-model/","version0Field":"","version1Field":"","version2Field":"","version3Field":"","closing":"Let me know if you have any other questions and I will be happy to help!

After clicking the \"Record\" button, look for a notification at the top of the window and click \"Allow\" when prompted. If you do not see a notification, our site may have been blocked previously. In that case, you may see an icon of a video camera with a red X through it. Click on this icon, then click \"Allow\", and \"Reload\" when prompted. You should then be able to complete your recording successfully.<br/><br/>If you still can't record, then the version of Flash that is installed on your computer may only be compatible with a USB microphone. Newer versions of Flash are designed specifically to work with microphones that connect via USB ports.

That is up to each teacher to decide based on a student&rsquo;s unique circumstances or learning goals.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students&rsquo; working grade levels. For example, a level of 100 indicates readiness to work on first-grade level skills. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>All student levels start as a range while the Diagnostic continues to narrow down that data. When the Diagnostic has enough information to pinpoint the student's level, it will appear as a single number. If you&rsquo;d like, you can learn more about the IXL Continuous Diagnostic by viewing our QuickStart guide <a href=\"https://www.ixl.com/userguides/us/IXLQuickStart_Diagnostic.pdf\">here</a>.","version0Field":"","version1Field":"","version2Field":"","version3Field":"","closing":"Please let me know if you have any questions.

Our SmartScore not only considers whether a student got a question right or wrong, but how difficult the question was and how they've been performing on other questions before and after. For example, two students might each have answered 20 of 25 questions correctly, but might actually have quite different levels of understanding (and different SmartScores). If the one student answered the first 5 questions incorrectly, then understood their mistake and answered the next 20 questions correctly it would indicate that they're now doing quite well, even though they struggled initially, and that student would have a high SmartScore. If another student answered the first 20 questions correctly, but then got to a higher degree of difficulty and answered the next 5 questions incorrectly it would mean that they had hit a plateau and would likely benefit from some intervention. Such a student's SmartScore would be lower than the first student's, to reflect that they were struggling with the more difficult questions. <br>\n<br>One report I would particularly recommend to how your class is doing on a particular skill is the \"Skill Diagnostics\" report. To view this report, click on the \"Analytics\" tab, then click \"Skills\" and select the skill you're interested in from the list, or find it using the drop-down list on the right side above the list of skills. This report will both provide you with overall let you see how each student is performing, broken down into the various stages of the skill. You can hover your mouse over a student's name to see the number of questions and time spent on that skill, or click on their name to see a log of all the questions they answered and how they performed over time. <br>\n<br>Alternatively, for an even higher-level view that lets you see all your students results across all skills at once you can click \"Scores\" under the \"Analytics\" tab to access the Score Grid. The Score Grid will allow you to see each student's score in every skill, all at once. It can even be exported as a spreadsheet by clicking the icon next to the title of the report, in case that would help with your grading. <br>\n<br>Please let me know if you have questions.

This feature allows you to sync data from your school or district SIS into your IXL account through an SFTP connection. This effectively allows you to manage your IXL students, teachers, and classes centrally from your SIS. Once the Auto-Roster feature is enabled, you will no longer be able to manage students and teachers manually through the IXL website.

To help build foundational reading skills for students, I suggest having them practice all of the phonics skills available in language arts beginning with Level A - A.3 \"Choose the two words that are the same\". You can find a list of all the phonics skills here:<br><br>https://www.ixl.com/ela/phonics<br><br>You may find these skills particularly helpful in providing targeted practice for students to assist with improving their reading skills:<br><br>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/put-the-sounds-in-order<br>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/choose-the-letter-that-matches-the-consonant-sound<br>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/choose-the-words-that-have-a-given-ending<br>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/choose-the-short-a-word-that-matches-the-picture<br><br>I also suggest having your students begin practicing in the Diagnostic Arena. The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students’ working grade levels. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.<br><br>In order to get started with the IXL Diagnostic, students can begin by signing in to their accounts and clicking Diagnostic at the top of the page. We recommend that students initially aim to diagnose until they reveal complete Diagnostic data. For most students this will be about 60-100 questions, which don’t have to be done in one sitting. The amount of questions needed to diagnose will also vary based on each student’s performance and existing practice results, as previous student practice will be taken into account. Once the student has finished the Diagnostic, we recommend students answer about 5-10 diagnostic questions per week to keep the Diagnostic up to date.","closing":"Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to help!","category":"Skills","program":"IXL","id":"J6O6X1W5W7N1W6K1O6","updatedDate":"Oct 15, 2018","addedByUser":"bcoleman@ixl.com","ranking":16,"copyFull":7,"copyPortion":9,"team":"techSupport","publicStatus":"true","replyEmail":["help@ixl.com"],"tags":"@IXL, disability, dyslexic","versions":[["Version1",""],["Version2",""],["Version3",""],["Version4",""]],"vetted":"No","quote":false},{"_id":"5b02f04df66b5103f6f5b452","name":"Switching payment schedule","greeting":"Thank you for reaching out.","body":"<span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Thank you for reaching out.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">To switch your membership to TIME PERIOD, please follow these steps:</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">1) Go to&nbsp;</span><a style=\"color: #006cb5; text-decoration-line: none; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" href=\"https://www.ixl.com/signin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" shape=\"rect\">https://www.ixl.com/signin</a><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;and sign in to your parent profile.</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">2) Click the arrow next to&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Welcome, Parent!</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;in the top-right corner to open your account menu, then select&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Membership Details</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">.</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">3) In the box titled&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Membership information</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">, select&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">switch to TIME PERIOD.</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">4) Click Submit.</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">When your membership renews on DATE, your new rate will be PRICE per TIME.&nbsp;</span>","closing":"If you have any questions, let me know and I will be happy to assist you.

For example, one student may take twenty minutes to reach a SmartScore of 80, whereas another student may take two hours to reach a SmartScore of 80 on the same skill.","greeting":"default","closing":"default","updatedDate":"Oct 11, 2018","addedByUser":"bcoleman@salesforce.com","team":"techSupport","publicStatus":"true","program":"IXL","replyEmail":["help@ixl.com"],"folder":"qr","tags":"@IXL, grade, percentage, gradebook","category":"SmartScore","ranking":17,"copyFull":7,"copyPortion":10,"name":"Using SmartScore as a grade","versions":[["Version1",""],["Version2",""],["Version3",""],["Version4",""]],"vetted":"No","quote":false},{"_id":"5afc8cdf454d983504af172c","id":"D8Y2P9T3Q8X5R3S2E7","body":"The percent of correct answers for each skill is incorporated into the SmartScore.

We value your feedback and I will share your experiences with our design team.<br/><br/>I’d like to share some information and suggestions that may help alleviate some of the frustration you and your child are experiencing.<br/><br/><strong>For you:</strong><ul><li><strong>What is a SmartScore?</strong> The SmartScore is an up-to-the-minute measure of a student’s progress toward mastery, so you can think of 0-70 as practicing or learning a skill, 71-90 as refining a skill with questions of mid- and high-level rigor, and 91-100 as working through difficult questions to cement mastery. As a result, the SmartScore will go up and down at different rates as your child progresses through a skill. </li><li><strong>80 is a great place to start:</strong> When your child first begins a new skill, setting a SmartScore goal of 80 is a great place to start. A SmartScore of 80  indicates that your child has a solid understanding of the concept. Later in the month, challenge your child to reach 90, or to master the skill for extra credit.</li><li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Setting goals of answering a certain number of questions a day or practicing for a certain amount of time is another great strategy. Practicing for even just 10 minutes a day is proven to increase fluency and confidence.</li></ul><strong>For your child:</strong><ul><li><strong>No need to rush:</strong>  Challenge Zone questions can be tough, and it takes several correct answers in a row to reach 100. Check your answers, work carefully, and use the knowledge you’ve gained from earlier questions in the skill. </li><li><strong>Use IXL’s explanations:</strong> The Challenge Zone is about solidifying your skills, so if you miss a question, read the explanation to get the key steps and strategies you need. </li><li><strong>Take a break and come back:</strong> If you are getting frustrated, try practicing a different skill for a while, then come back to that first skill and try again later.</li><li><strong>Remember that 100 is always within reach:</strong> SmartScore is a measure of progress, so no matter how many questions you miss along the way, you always have the chance to reach mastery in a skill on IXL.</li></ul>I hope you and your child find some of these suggestions helpful.  You can visit our <a href=\"https://www.ixl.com/help_docs/SmartScoreGuide.pdf\">SmartScore guide</a> if you would like to learn more about how the SmartScore works.","greeting":"none","closing":"Feel free to reach out with any other questions, and I will be happy to help.","updatedDate":"Dec 1, 2018","addedByUser":"salesforce@salesforce.com","team":"techSupport","publicStatus":"true","program":"IXL","replyEmail":"help@ixl.com","folder":"TS IXL Reports, SS, emails","tags":"01.1  @IXL","category":"SmartScore","ranking":71,"copyFull":30,"copyPortion":41,"name":"SmartScore explained (parent)","vetted":"Yes","quote":false},{"_id":"5afc7adb8abe7879de73d7d1","id":"X06_Add_a_file_to_Quia_Questions","greeting":"Thank you for contacting Quia.

The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students&rsquo; working grade levels. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.<br/><br/>In order to get started with the IXL Diagnostic, students can begin by signing in to their accounts and clicking <strong>Diagnostic</strong> at the top of the page. We recommend that students initially aim to diagnose until they reveal complete Diagnostic data. For most students this will be about 60-90 questions, which don&rsquo;t have to be done in one sitting. The amount of questions needed to diagnose will also vary based on each student&rsquo;s performance and existing practice results, as previous student practice will be taken into account. Once the student has finished the Diagnostic, we recommend students answer about 5-10 diagnostic questions per week to keep the Diagnostic up to date.<br/><br/>The Diagnostic level indicates a student&rsquo;s working grade level. For example, a level of 500 indicates readiness to work on fifth-grade level skills. All student levels start as a range while the Diagnostic continues to narrow down that data as the student diagnoses. When the Diagnostic has enough information to pinpoint the student's level, it will appear as a single number.","greeting":"Thank you for reaching out to us.","closing":"Please let me know if you have any other questions.

We value your feedback and I will share your experiences with our design team.<br/><br/>I’d like to share some information and suggestions that may help alleviate some of the frustration you and your class are experiencing.<br/><br/><strong>For you:</strong><ul><li><strong>What is a SmartScore?</strong> The SmartScore is an up-to-the-minute measure of a student’s progress toward mastery, so you can think of 0-70 as practicing or learning a skill, 71-90 as refining a skill with questions of mid- and high-level rigor, and 91-100 as working through difficult questions to cement mastery. As a result, the SmartScore will go up and down at different rates as children progress through a skill. </li><li><strong>80 is a great place to start:</strong> When a student first begins a new skill, setting a SmartScore goal of 80 is a great place to start. A SmartScore of 80 indicates that a student has a solid understanding of the concept. Later in the month, challenge students to reach 90, or to master the skill for extra credit.</li><li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Setting goals of answering a certain number of questions a day or practicing for a certain amount of time is another great strategy. Practicing for even just 10 minutes a day is proven to increase fluency and confidence.</li></ul><strong>For your students:</strong><ul><li><strong>No need to rush:</strong> Challenge Zone questions can be tough, and it takes several correct answers in a row to reach 100. Check your answers, work carefully, and use the knowledge you’ve gained from earlier questions in the skill.</li><li><strong>Use IXL’s explanations:</strong> The Challenge Zone is about solidifying your skills, so if you miss a question, read the explanation to get the key steps and strategies you need.</li><li><strong>Take a break and come back:</strong> If you are getting frustrated, try practicing a different skill for a while, then come back to that first skill and try again later.</li><li><strong>Remember that 100 is always within reach:</strong> SmartScore is a measure of progress, so no matter how many questions you miss along the way, you always have the chance to reach mastery in a skill on IXL.</li></ul>I hope you and your class find some of these suggestions helpful.
