You can find a list of all the phonics skills here:<br/><br/>https://www.ixl.com/ela/phonics<br/><br/>You may find these skills particularly helpful in providing targeted practice for students to assist with improving their reading skills:<br/><br/>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/put-the-sounds-in-order<br/>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/choose-the-letter-that-matches-the-consonant-sound<br/>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/choose-the-words-that-have-a-given-ending<br/>https://www.ixl.com/ela/kindergarten/choose-the-short-a-word-that-matches-the-picture<br/><br/>I also suggest having your students begin practicing in the Diagnostic Arena. The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students’ working grade levels. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.<br/><br/>In order to get started with the IXL Diagnostic, students can begin by signing in to their accounts and clicking Diagnostic at the top of the page. We recommend that students initially aim to diagnose until they reveal complete Diagnostic data. For most students this will be about 60-100 questions, which don’t have to be done in one sitting. The amount of questions needed to diagnose will also vary based on each student’s performance and existing practice results, as previous student practice will be taken into account. Once the student has finished the Diagnostic, we recommend students answer about 5-10 diagnostic questions per week to keep the Diagnostic up to date.","closing":"Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to help!","category":"Skills","program":"IXL","id":"J6O6X1W5W7N1W6K1O6","updatedDate":"May 21, 2018","addedByUser":"bcoleman@ixl.com","ranking":1,"copyFull":1,"copyPortion":0,"team":"techSupport","publicStatus":"true","replyEmail":["help@ixl.com"],"tags":"@IXL, disability"},{"_id":"5b02f04df66b5103f6f5b452","name":"Switching payment schedule","greeting":"Thank you for reaching out.","body":"<span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Thank you for reaching out.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">To switch your membership to TIME PERIOD, please follow these steps:</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">1) Go to&nbsp;</span><a style=\"color: #006cb5; text-decoration-line: none; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" href=\"https://www.ixl.com/signin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" shape=\"rect\">https://www.ixl.com/signin</a><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;and sign in to your parent profile.</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">2) Click the arrow next to&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Welcome, Parent!</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;in the top-right corner to open your account menu, then select&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Membership Details</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">.</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">3) In the box titled&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">Membership information</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">, select&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">switch to TIME PERIOD.</strong><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">4) Click Submit.</span><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><br style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\" clear=\"none\" /><span style=\"color: #16325c; font-family: SalesforceSans-Regular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">When your membership renews on DATE, your new rate will be PRICE per TIME.&nbsp;</span>","closing":"If you have any questions, let me know and I will be happy to assist you.

In other words, if students attempted all 25 questions, they earn a score of 10 in the gradebook. If students attempted 20-24 questions, they earn a score of 7 in the gradebook.

This way, teachers have an accurate understanding of students' proficiency within the skill within the Students quickview report, and can give students points for completing the assignment.<br/><br/>This model can also be used for assigning a set amount of time for students to practice. For example, teachers can ask students to practice 10 minutes per day (instead of 5 questions), and use the same scoring model to address the total number of minutes per week.

I’m sorry to hear that you and your child have been frustrated by the scoring, and I appreciate that you’ve reached out to let us know. We value your feedback and I will share your experiences with our design team.<br/><br/>I’d like to share some information and suggestions that may help alleviate some of the frustration you and your child are experiencing.<br/><br/><strong>For you:</strong><ul><li><strong>What is a SmartScore?</strong> The SmartScore is an up-to-the-minute measure of a student’s progress toward mastery, so you can think of 0-70 as practicing or learning a skill, 71-90 as refining a skill with questions of mid- and high-level rigor, and 91-100 as working through difficult questions to cement mastery. As a result, the SmartScore will go up and down at different rates as your child progresses through a skill. </li><li><strong>80 is a great place to start:</strong> When your child first begins a new skill, setting a SmartScore goal of 80 is a great place to start. A SmartScore of 80  indicates that your child has a solid understanding of the concept. Later in the month, challenge your child to reach 90, or to master the skill for extra credit.</li><li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Setting goals of answering a certain number of questions a day or practicing for a certain amount of time is another great strategy. Practicing for even just 10 minutes a day is proven to increase fluency and confidence.</li></ul><strong>For your child:</strong><ul><li><strong>No need to rush:</strong>  Challenge Zone questions can be tough, and it takes several correct answers in a row to reach 100. Check your answers, work carefully, and use the knowledge you’ve gained from earlier questions in the skill. </li><li><strong>Use IXL’s explanations:</strong> The Challenge Zone is about solidifying your skills, so if you miss a question, read the explanation to get the key steps and strategies you need. </li><li><strong>Take a break and come back:</strong> If you are getting frustrated, try practicing a different skill for a while, then come back to that first skill and try again later.</li><li><strong>Remember that 100 is always within reach:</strong> SmartScore is a measure of progress, so no matter how many questions you miss along the way, you always have the chance to reach mastery in a skill on IXL.</li></ul>I hope you and your child find some of these suggestions helpful.

The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students&rsquo; working grade levels. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.<br/><br/>In order to get started with the IXL Diagnostic, students can begin by signing in to their accounts and clicking <strong>Diagnostic</strong> at the top of the page. We recommend that students initially aim to diagnose until they reveal complete Diagnostic data. For most students this will be about 60-90 questions, which don&rsquo;t have to be done in one sitting. The amount of questions needed to diagnose will also vary based on each student&rsquo;s performance and existing practice results, as previous student practice will be taken into account. Once the student has finished the Diagnostic, we recommend students answer about 5-10 diagnostic questions per week to keep the Diagnostic up to date.<br/><br/>The Diagnostic level indicates a student&rsquo;s working grade level. For example, a level of 500 indicates readiness to work on fifth-grade level skills. All student levels start as a range while the Diagnostic continues to narrow down that data as the student diagnoses. When the Diagnostic has enough information to pinpoint the student's level, it will appear as a single number.","greeting":"Thank you for reaching out to us.","closing":"Please let me know if you have any other questions.

I’m sorry to hear that you and your students have been frustrated by the scoring, and I appreciate that you’ve reached out to let us know. We value your feedback and I will share your experiences with our design team.<br/><br/>I’d like to share some information and suggestions that may help alleviate some of the frustration you and your class are experiencing.<br/><br/><strong>For you:</strong><ul><li><strong>What is a SmartScore?</strong> The SmartScore is an up-to-the-minute measure of a student’s progress toward mastery, so you can think of 0-70 as practicing or learning a skill, 71-90 as refining a skill with questions of mid- and high-level rigor, and 91-100 as working through difficult questions to cement mastery. As a result, the SmartScore will go up and down at different rates as children progress through a skill. </li><li><strong>80 is a great place to start:</strong> When a student first begins a new skill, setting a SmartScore goal of 80 is a great place to start. A SmartScore of 80 indicates that a student has a solid understanding of the concept. Later in the month, challenge students to reach 90, or to master the skill for extra credit.</li><li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Setting goals of answering a certain number of questions a day or practicing for a certain amount of time is another great strategy. Practicing for even just 10 minutes a day is proven to increase fluency and confidence.</li></ul><strong>For your students:</strong><ul><li><strong>No need to rush:</strong> Challenge Zone questions can be tough, and it takes several correct answers in a row to reach 100. Check your answers, work carefully, and use the knowledge you’ve gained from earlier questions in the skill.</li><li><strong>Use IXL’s explanations:</strong> The Challenge Zone is about solidifying your skills, so if you miss a question, read the explanation to get the key steps and strategies you need.</li><li><strong>Take a break and come back:</strong> If you are getting frustrated, try practicing a different skill for a while, then come back to that first skill and try again later.</li><li><strong>Remember that 100 is always within reach:</strong> SmartScore is a measure of progress, so no matter how many questions you miss along the way, you always have the chance to reach mastery in a skill on IXL.</li></ul>I hope you and your class find some of these suggestions helpful.
