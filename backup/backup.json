With ClassLink, you can set up an SFTP connection to IXL and export your user and class data in the OneRoster v1.1 standard.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>If you would like to move forward with the Auto-Rostering feature, please let me know and I will enable this for the account. Enabling the feature will generate an SFTP key that I can provide to you so that you can access the server to upload files.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Do you have a preferred SFTP username? If you do not have a preference, your username will be a randomly generated 4 digit code.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>​Please let me know if you have any questions, and I will be happy to assist further.",
