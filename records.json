The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students\u0026rsquo; working grade levels. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn order to get started with the IXL Diagnostic, students can begin by signing in to their accounts and clicking \u003cstrong\u003eDiagnostic\u003c/strong\u003e at the top of the page. We recommend that students initially aim to diagnose until they reveal complete Diagnostic data. For most students this will be about 60-90 questions, which don\u0026rsquo;t have to be done in one sitting. The amount of questions needed to diagnose will also vary based on each student\u0026rsquo;s performance and existing practice results, as previous student practice will be taken into account. Once the student has finished the Diagnostic, we recommend students answer about 5-10 diagnostic questions per week to keep the Diagnostic up to date.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe Diagnostic level indicates a student\u0026rsquo;s working grade level. For example, a level of 500 indicates readiness to work on fifth-grade level skills. All student levels start as a range while the Diagnostic continues to narrow down that data as the student diagnoses. When the Diagnostic has enough information to pinpoint the student's level, it will appear as a single number.","greeting":"Thank you for reaching out to us.","closing":"Please let me know if you have any other questions.

We value your feedback and I will share your experiences with our design team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’d like to share some information and suggestions that may help alleviate some of the frustration you and your child are experiencing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a SmartScore?\u003c/strong\u003e The SmartScore is an up-to-the-minute measure of a student’s progress toward mastery, so you can think of 0-70 as practicing or learning a skill, 71-90 as refining a skill with questions of mid- and high-level rigor, and 91-100 as working through difficult questions to cement mastery. As a result, the SmartScore will go up and down at different rates as your child progresses through a skill. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e80 is a great place to start:\u003c/strong\u003e When your child first begins a new skill, setting a SmartScore goal of 80 is a great place to start. A SmartScore of 80  indicates that your child has a solid understanding of the concept. Later in the month, challenge your child to reach 90, or to master the skill for extra credit.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet goals:\u003c/strong\u003e Setting goals of answering a certain number of questions a day or practicing for a certain amount of time is another great strategy. Practicing for even just 10 minutes a day is proven to increase fluency and confidence.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor your child:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo need to rush:\u003c/strong\u003e  Challenge Zone questions can be tough, and it takes several correct answers in a row to reach 100. Check your answers, work carefully, and use the knowledge you’ve gained from earlier questions in the skill. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse IXL’s explanations:\u003c/strong\u003e The Challenge Zone is about solidifying your skills, so if you miss a question, read the explanation to get the key steps and strategies you need. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake a break and come back:\u003c/strong\u003e If you are getting frustrated, try practicing a different skill for a while, then come back to that first skill and try again later.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember that 100 is always within reach:\u003c/strong\u003e SmartScore is a measure of progress, so no matter how many questions you miss along the way, you always have the chance to reach mastery in a skill on IXL.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI hope you and your child find some of these suggestions helpful.

We value your feedback and I will share your experiences with our design team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’d like to share some information and suggestions that may help alleviate some of the frustration you and your class are experiencing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a SmartScore?\u003c/strong\u003e The SmartScore is an up-to-the-minute measure of a student’s progress toward mastery, so you can think of 0-70 as practicing or learning a skill, 71-90 as refining a skill with questions of mid- and high-level rigor, and 91-100 as working through difficult questions to cement mastery. As a result, the SmartScore will go up and down at different rates as children progress through a skill. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e80 is a great place to start:\u003c/strong\u003e When a student first begins a new skill, setting a SmartScore goal of 80 is a great place to start. A SmartScore of 80 indicates that a student has a solid understanding of the concept. Later in the month, challenge students to reach 90, or to master the skill for extra credit.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet goals:\u003c/strong\u003e Setting goals of answering a certain number of questions a day or practicing for a certain amount of time is another great strategy. Practicing for even just 10 minutes a day is proven to increase fluency and confidence.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor your students:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo need to rush:\u003c/strong\u003e Challenge Zone questions can be tough, and it takes several correct answers in a row to reach 100. Check your answers, work carefully, and use the knowledge you’ve gained from earlier questions in the skill.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse IXL’s explanations:\u003c/strong\u003e The Challenge Zone is about solidifying your skills, so if you miss a question, read the explanation to get the key steps and strategies you need.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake a break and come back:\u003c/strong\u003e If you are getting frustrated, try practicing a different skill for a while, then come back to that first skill and try again later.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember that 100 is always within reach:\u003c/strong\u003e SmartScore is a measure of progress, so no matter how many questions you miss along the way, you always have the chance to reach mastery in a skill on IXL.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI hope you and your class find some of these suggestions helpful.

At the bottom of the menu, click the second tab from the left (it looks like a monitor with an eye on it). \n4. Make sure the \"Allow\" option and the \"Remember\" checkbox are selected. \n5. Click the fourth tab (the one with a microphone on it). \n6. Make sure the record volume is up all the way and the correct microphone is selected from the drop-down list. (If you have the correct microphone selected, you will see a green and red bar move whenever you speak into your microphone.) \n7. Click \"Close\". \n\nPlease note that if you are using Google Chrome as your browser, it will also prompt you to give it permission to access your microphone. After clicking the \"Record\" button, look for a notification at the top of the window and click \"Allow\" when prompted. If you do not see a notification, our site may have been blocked previously. In that case, you may see an icon of a video camera with a red X through it. Click on this icon, then click \"Allow\", and click \"Reload\" when prompted. You should then be able to complete your recording successfully. \n\nIf you still can't record, then the version of Flash that is installed on your computer may only be compatible with a USB microphone. Newer versions of Flash are designed specifically to work with microphones that connect via USB ports. Using a USB microphone should solve the problem.\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","greeting":"","closing":"If you have any questions please let me know and I will be happy to assist.","updatedDate":"Apr 22, 2019","addedByUser":"salesforce@salesforce.com","team":"techSupport","publicStatus":"true","program":"QB","replyEmail":["bookhelp@quia.com"],"folder":"TS QB","tags":"06.1  @QB","category":"Audio","ranking":35,"copyFull":22,"copyPortion":13,"name":"Microphone Check (Chrome)","vetted":"","quote":false,"versions":[["Version1",""],["Version2",""],["Version3",""],["Version4",""]],"lastUpdatedByUser":"chlsposey@gmail.com"}

The IXL Diagnostic is designed to give you a snapshot of each of your students’ working grade levels. It also groups students working at similar levels and can show the most common skill recommendations for each of the student groups, allowing you to plan for small-group instruction. It tells you exactly what students know and what to do next to to help them improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to get started with the IXL Diagnostic, students can begin by signing in to their accounts and clicking Diagnostic at the top of the page. We recommend that students initially aim to diagnose until they reveal complete Diagnostic data. For most students this will be about 60-100 questions, which don’t have to be done in one sitting. The amount of questions needed to diagnose will also vary based on each student’s performance and existing practice results, as previous student practice will be taken into account. Once the student has finished the Diagnostic, we recommend students answer about 5-10 diagnostic questions per week to keep the Diagnostic up to date.","closing":"Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to help!","category":"Skills","program":"IXL","id":"J6O6X1W5W7N1W6K1O6","updatedDate":"Apr 24, 2019","addedByUser":"bcoleman@ixl.com","ranking":18,"copyFull":8,"copyPortion":10,"team":"techSupport","publicStatus":"true","replyEmail":["help@ixl.com"],"tags":"@IXL, disability, dyslexic","versions":[["Version1",""],["Version2",""],["Version3",""],["Version4",""]],"vetted":"No","quote":false,"lastUpdatedByUser":"mackessonsgw@gmail.com"}

We recommend that students initially aim to answer 50-85 questions per subject to reveal complete Diagnostic data, which doesn’t have to be done in one sitting. Once complete data is revealed, students can answer 10-15 diagnostic questions per week to keep the IXL Continuous Diagnostic up to date.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou’ll know students have revealed completed Diagnostic data when their working grade levels narrow down to a single number, showing their level in each strand as well as their overall level.

Our SmartScore not only considers whether a student got a question right or wrong, but how difficult the question was and how they've been performing on other questions before and after. For example, two students might each have answered 20 of 25 questions correctly, but might actually have quite different levels of understanding (and different SmartScores). If the one student answered the first 5 questions incorrectly, then understood their mistake and answered the next 20 questions correctly it would indicate that they're now doing quite well, even though they struggled initially, and that student would have a high SmartScore. If another student answered the first 20 questions correctly, but then got to a higher degree of difficulty and answered the next 5 questions incorrectly it would mean that they had hit a plateau and would likely benefit from some intervention. Such a student's SmartScore would be lower than the first student's, to reflect that they were struggling with the more difficult questions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOne report I would particularly recommend to how your class is doing on a particular skill is the \"Skill Diagnostics\" report. To view this report, click on the \"Analytics\" tab, then click \"Skills\" and select the skill you're interested in from the list, or find it using the drop-down list on the right side above the list of skills. This report will both provide you with overall let you see how each student is performing, broken down into the various stages of the skill. You can hover your mouse over a student's name to see the number of questions and time spent on that skill, or click on their name to see a log of all the questions they answered and how they performed over time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlternatively, for an even higher-level view that lets you see all your students results across all skills at once you can click \"Scores\" under the \"Analytics\" tab to access the Score Grid. The Score Grid will allow you to see each student's score in every skill, all at once. It can even be exported as a spreadsheet by clicking the icon next to the title of the report, in case that would help with your grading. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease let me know if you have questions.

Many wireless environment have a shorter session \"time-out\" than a wired Ethernet connection. This is by design for security reasons since wireless provides greater access to many more devices. School and public access wireless connections can be as short as 20 minutes or less before the device's session is terminated. In contrast, Quia's connection session has a duration of 12 hours.
