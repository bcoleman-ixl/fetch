-Make it easier to identify platform for estudio, HLC, QuiaBooks, etc. in QB templates. (Versions).
-Debbie suggested adding the template numbers as tags. For example, the skill error template will have a tag `07`. So if you want to look for that template, you could just type `07` in the search bar and it would come up. I'm going to add this to a list of feature requests. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts.
-Add number next to search bar that shows total number of templates found
-Have each EJS do the rank computation, rather than the javascript. (Speed!)
-Make a way to paste in the username and pw link into the user/pass request e-mail and have it generate an e-mail with the username and link to be ready to copy and paste. Have it identify if the username is a custom domain, if so, then include that in the sign in link.
