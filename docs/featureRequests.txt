1. Debbie suggested adding the template numbers as tags. For example, the skill error template will have a tag `07`. So if you want to look for that template, you could just type `07` in the search bar and it would come up. I'm going to add this to a list of feature requests. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts.

2. Check if user still signed in when updating a template in admin Console

3. Do  not refresh page after update.

4. Have each EJS do the rank computation, rather than the javascript. (Speed!)

5. Add number next to search bar that shows total number of templates found
