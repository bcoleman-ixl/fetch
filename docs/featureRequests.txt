Debbie suggested adding the template numbers as tags. For example, the skill error template will have a tag `07`. So if you want to look for that template, you could just type `07` in the search bar and it would come up. I'm going to add this to a list of feature requests. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts.

Have each EJS do the rank computation, rather than the javascript. (Speed!)
